# nanokvm-control-api
An API to run on a Nanokvm to control power and switch inputs via i2c

## Dependencies

* Outputs controlled via a PCF8574 i2c expander

This is designed to run on a NanoKVM Lite and work in my very specific implementation. It is probably not useful for you, but I open-sourced it so people can look at it and potenitally find use.

## Crates Used

* tiny-http
* pcf857x

## LLM Usage

I used LLMs while working on this project. I wouldn't call it "vibe-coded" but if you have issues with code that has LLM generated components, do not use this project.
